# Refget API Specification v0.2

## Design principles
Refget enables access to reference sequences using an identifier derived from the sequence itself. The API has the following features:

- The checksum algorithm used to derive the sequence identifier shall be a mainstream algorithm available standard across multiple platforms and programming languages.
- The client may request a sub-sequence, which the server is expected to honour

Explicitly this API does NOT:

- Provide a way to discover identifiers for valid sequences. Clients obtain these via some out of band mechanism

## OpenAPI 3.0 Description

An OpenAPI description of this specification is available and [describes the 0.2 version](pub/refget-openapi.yaml).

## Protocol essentials

All API invocations are made to a configurable HTTP(S) endpoint, receive URL-encoded query string parameters, and return text or other allowed formatting as requested by the user. Successful requests result with HTTP status code 200 and have the appropriate text encoding in the response body as defined for each endpoint. The server may provide responses with chunked transfer encoding. The client and server may mutually negotiate HTTP/2 upgrade using the standard mechanism.

The response for sequence retrieval has a character set of US-ASCII and consists solely of the requested sequence or sub-sequence with no line breaks. Other formatting of the response sequence may be allowed by the server, subject to standard negotiation with the client via the Accept header.

Requests adhering to this specification MAY include an Accept header specifying an alternative formatting of the response, if the server allows this. Otherwise the server shall return the default content type specified for the invoked method.

HTTP responses may be compressed using [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html) transfer-coding, not content-coding.

HTTP response may include a 3XX response code and Location header redirecting the client to retrieve sequence data from an alternate location as specified by [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231), clients SHOULD be configured follow redirects. `302`, `303` and `307` are all valid response codes to use.

Range headers are the preferred method for clients making sub-sequence requests, as specified by [RFC 7233](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233).

Requests MAY include an Accept header specifying the protocol version they are using:

```
Accept: text/vnd.ga4gh.refget.v1.0.0+plain
```

Responses from the server MUST include a Content-Type header containing the encoding for the invoked method and protocol version:

```
Content-Type: text/vnd.ga4gh.refget.v1.0.0+plain; charset=us-ascii
```

## Errors
The server MUST respond with an appropriate HTTP status code (4xx or 5xx) when an error condition is detected. In the case of transient server errors (e.g., 503 and other 5xx status codes), the client SHOULD implement appropriate retry logic. For example, if a client sends an alphanumeric string for a parameter that is specified as unsigned integer the server MUST reply with `Bad Request`.

| Error type             | HTTP status code | Description                                                                                          |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Bad Request`            | 400              | Cannot process due to malformed request, the requested parameters do not adhere to the specification |
| `Unauthorized`           | 401              | Authorization provided is invalid                                                                    |
| `Not Found`              | 404              | The resource requested was not found                                                                 |
| `Unsupported Media Type` | 415              | The requested sequence formatting is not supported by the server                                     |
| `Range Not Satisfiable`  | 416              | The Range request cannot be satisfied                                                                |
| `Not Implemented`        | 501              | The specified request is not supported by the server                                                 |

## Security
Reference sequence as defined in this specification is publicly accessible without restrictions. However the refget API retrieval mechanism can be used to retrieve potentially sensitive genomic data and is dependent on the implementation. Effective security measures are essential to protect the integrity and confidentiality of these data.

Sensitive information transmitted on public networks, such as access tokens and human genomic data, MUST be protected using Transport Level Security (TLS) version 1.2 or later, as specified in [RFC 5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246).

If the data holder requires client authentication and/or authorization, then the client's HTTPS API request MUST present an OAuth 2.0 bearer access token as specified in [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750), in the Authorization request header field with the Bearer authentication scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer [access_token]
```

The policies and processes used to perform user authentication and authorization, and the means through which access tokens are issued, are beyond the scope of this API specification. GA4GH recommends the use of the OAuth 2.0 framework ([RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)) for authentication and authorization.

## Checksum calculation
The supported checksum algorithms are `MD5` (a 32 character HEX string) and a SHA-512 based system called `TRUNC512` (a 48 character HEX string, see later for details). Servers MUST support sequence retrieval by one or more of these algorithms, and are encouraged to support all to maximize interoperability. To provide CRAM Reference Registry compatibility an implementation must support MD5.

When calculating the checksum for a sequence, all non-base symbols (\n, spaces, etc) must be removed and then uppercase the rest. The allowed alphabet for checksum calculation is uppercase ASCII (`0x41`-`0x5A` or `A-Z`).

Resulting hexadecimal checksum strings shall be considered case insensitive. 0xa is equivalent to 0xA.

## refget Checksum Algorithm
The refget checksum algorithm is called `TRUNC512`. It is based and derived from work carried out by the GA4GH VMC group. It is defined as follows:

- SHA-512 digest of a sanitised sequence
- A hex-encoding of the first 24 bytes of that digest resulting in a 48 character string

Services may also implement the VMC URL safe representation of a truncated SHA-512 string. `TRUNC512` is compatible with the VMC specification through reformatting of the input string.

See later in this specification for implementation details of the TRUNC512 algorithm and conversion between TRUNC512 and VMC.

## CORS
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an essential technique used to overcome the same origin content policy seen in browsers. This policy restricts a webpage from making a request to another website and leaking potentially sensitive information. However the same origin policy is a barrier to using open APIs. GA4GH open API implementers should enable CORS to an acceptable level as defined by their internal policy. For any public API implementations should allow requests from any server.

GA4GH is publishing a [CORS best practices document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ifiik9afTO-CEpWGKEZ5TlixQ6tiKcvug4XLd9GNcqo/edit?usp=sharing), which implementers should refer to for guidance when enabling CORS on public API instances.

## API Methods

### Method: get sequence by ID

`GET /sequence/<id>`

The primary method for accessing specified sequence data. The response is the requested sequence or sub-sequence in text unless an alternative formatting supported by the server is requested.

The client may specify a genomic range to retrieve a sub-sequence via either the Range header OR start/end query parameters, however the Range header is the recommended method. If a sub-sequence is requested via `start`/`end` query parameters, the response must be 200 and only contain the specified sub-sequence. If a sub-sequence is requested via a Range header, the response must be one of 206 and only contain the specified sub-sequence, be 200 and contain the entire sequence (thus ignoring the Range header), or 303 redirecting the client to where it can retrieve the sequence.

If a sub-sequence is requested, the response must only contain the specified sub-sequence. A server may place a length limit on sub-sequences returned via query parameter, queries exceeding this limit shall return `Range Not Satisfiable`.

If `start` and `end` are set to the same value the server should return a 0-length string.

A server may support circular chromosomes as a reference sequence, but this is not mandatory. If a reference sequence represents a circular chromosome and the server supports circular chromosomes, a sub-sequence query with a start greater than the end will return the sequence from the start location to the end of the reference, immediately followed by the sequence from the first base to the end. If the server supports circular chromosomes and the chromosome is not circular or the range is outside the bounds of the chromosome the server shall return `Range Not Satisfiable`. Otherwise if circular chromosomes are not supported, a `Not Implemented` shall be returned. Sub-sequences of circular chromosomes across the origin may not be requested via the Range header.

|-----------|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Range`   | string                  | Optional | Range header as specified in [RFC 7233](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-3.1), however only a single byte range per GET request is supported by the specification. The byte range of the sequence to return, 0-based inclusive of start and end bytes specified. The server MUST respond with a `Bad Request` error if both a Range header and start or end query parameters are specified. The server MUST respond with a `Bad Request` error if one or more ranges are out of bounds of the sequence.                                                                                                                     |
| `Accept`    | string                  | Optional | The formatting of the returned sequence, defaults to `text/vnd.ga4gh.refget.v1.0.0+plain` if not specified. A server MAY support other formatting of the sequence.The server SHOULD respond with an `Unsupported Media Type` error if the client requests a format not supported by the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Response

The server shall return the requested sequence or sub-sequence as a single string in uppercase ASCII text (bytes 0x41-0x5A) with no line terminators or other formatting characters. The server may return the sequence in an alternative formatting, such as JSON or FASTA, if requested by the client via the `Accept` header and the format is supported by the server.

On success and either a whole sequence or sub-sequence is returned the server shall issue a 200 status code if the entire sequence is returned or 206 if a sub-sequence is returned via a Range header.

If the identifier is not known by the server, a 404 status code and `NotFound` error shall be returned.

### Method: Get known metadata for an id

```
GET /sequence/<id>/metadata
```

Return all known names for an identifier and related metadata.

Due to the possibility of multiple checksum algorithms being supported by a server, and potentially other known aliases for a sequence existing, this method allows clients to query all known names for a given identifier as well as fetch any associated metadata.

#### Default encoding
Unless negotiated with the client and allowed by the server, the default encoding for this method is:

```
Content-type: application/vnd.ga4gh.refget.v1.0.0+json
```

#### URL parameters

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`      | string    | Yes      | A string specifying identifier to retrieve aliases for. The identifier shall be a checksum derived from the sequence using one of the supported checksum algorithms, or an alias for the sequence supported by the server. |

#### Response

The server shall return a list of all identifiers the server knows for the given identifier along with associated metadata. The server MAY return the query identifier in the list of identifiers.

A JSON encoded response shall have the following fields:

<table>
<tr markdown="block"><td>
<code>metadata</code><br/>

</td><td>
Container for response object.
<table>
<tr markdown="block"><td>
<code>md5</code><br/>

</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
</td></tr>
</table>

On success and the query identifier being known to the server, a 200 status code shall be returned.

If the identifier is not known by the server, a 404 status code shall be returned.

    "supported_api_versions: ["1.0"]
  }
}
```

## Range headers
GA4GH has a standard of 0-based, half-open coordinates however Range requests as described in RFC 7233 use a unit of bytes starting at 0 and inclusive of the first and last byte specified (although other units are permitted by the RFC). For this reason care must be taken when making a request with a Range header versus start/end in the query string. Range start and end would be with respect to the byte coordinates of the sequence as if it were stored in a file on disk as a continuous string with no carriage returns.

RFC 7233 permits multiple byte ranges in a request, for this specification only a single byte range per GET request is permitted.

For example, given the following sequence:

```
CAACAGAGACTGCTGCTGACAGTGGGCGGGGGAGTAGTTTGCTTGGCCCGTGGTTGAGGA
```

And a Range header to retrieve 10bp:

```
Range: bytes=5-14
```

The returned sub-sequence would be:

```
GAGACTGCTG
```

However a start/end for the same 10bp would be:

```
?start=5&end=15
```

Any formatting of the sequence a server might allow is applied after the the sub-sequence is selected, for example a server that supported returning fasta the result for the prior example could be:

```
>9f5b68f3ebc5f7b06a9b2e2b55297403 5-14
GAGACTGCTG
```

Any bytes added for formatting to the returned output should not be taken in to account when processing a Range request.

## TRUNC512 Algorithm Details

Below details the `TRUNC512` algorithm in Python and Perl including how to round-trip this to and from VMC representations.

### Python Example

```python
import base64
import hashlib
import binascii

def trunc512_digest(seq, offset=24):
    digest = hashlib.sha512(seq).digest()
    hex_digest = binascii.hexlify(digest[:offset])
    return hex_digest

def vmc_digest(seq, digest_size=24):
    # b64 encoding results in 4/3 size expansion of data and padded if
    # not multiple of 3, which doesn't make sense for this use
    assert digest_size % 3 == 0, "digest size must be multiple of 3"
    digest = hashlib.sha512(seq).digest()
    return _vmc_format(digest, digest_size)

def _vmc_format(digest, digest_size=24):
    tdigest_b64us = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(digest[:digest_size])
    return "VMC:GS_{}".format(tdigest_b64us)

def vmc_to_trunc512(vmc):
    base64_strip = vmc.replace("VMC:GS_","")
    digest = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(base64_strip)
    hex_digest = binascii.hexlify(digest)
    return hex_digest

def trunc512_to_vmc(trunc512):
    digest_length = len(trunc512)*2
    digest = binascii.unhexlify(trunc512)
    return _vmc_format(digest, digest_length)
```

sub trunc512_digest {
  my ($sequence, $digest_size) = @_;
  $digest_size //= 24;
  my $digest = sha512_hex($sequence);
  my $substring = substr($digest, 0, $digest_size*2);
  return $substring;
}

sub vmc_digest {
  my ($sequence, $digest_size) = @_;
  $digest_size //= 24;
  if(($digest_size % 3) != 0) {
    die "Digest size must be a multiple of 3 to avoid padded digests";
  }
  my $digest = sha512($sequence);
  return _vmc_bytes($digest, $digest_size);
}

sub _vmc_bytes {
  my ($bytes, $digest_size) = @_;
  my $base64 = encode_base64url($bytes);
  my $substr_offset = int($digest_size/3)*4;
  my $vmc = substr($base64, 0, $substr_offset);

}

sub vmc_to_trunc512 {
  my ($vmc) = @_;
  my ($base64) = $vmc =~ /VMC:GS_(.+)/;
  my $digest = unpack("H*", decode_base64url($base64));
  return $digest;
}

sub trunc512_to_vmc {
  my ($trunc_digest) = @_;
  my $digest_length = length($trunc_digest)/2;
  my $digest = pack("H*", $trunc_digest);
  return _vmc_bytes($digest, $digest_length);

## Design Rationale

This section details behind key API decisions.

### Checksum Input Normalisation

Key to generating reproducible checksums is the normalisation algorithm applied to sequence input. This API is based on the requirements of SAM/BAM, CRAM Reference Registry and VMC specifications. Both of these specs' own normalisation algorithms are detailed below:

- SAM/BAM
  - All characters outside of the inclusive range `33` (`0x21`/`!`) and `126` (`0x7E`/`~`) are stripped out
  - All lower-case characters are converted to upper-case
- CRAM Reference Registry
  - Input comes into the registry via ENA
  - ENA allows input conforming to the following regular expression `(?i)^([ACGTUMRWSYKVHDBN]+)\\*?$"`
- VMC
  - VMC requires sequence to be a string of IUPAC codes for either nucelotide or protein sequence

Considering the requirements of the three systems the specification designers felt it was sufficient to restrict input to the inclusive range `65` (`0x41`/`A`) to `90` (`0x5A`/`Z`). Changes to this normalisation algorthim would require a new checksum identifer to be used.

### Checksum Choice

MD5 provides adequate protection against hash collisions occurring from sequences. However the consequence of a sequence derived hash collision appearing would be catastrophic as two or more sequences with different content would report to be the same entity.

The VMC, Variant Modelling Collaboration, is a complementary GA4GH effort to model genomic variation based on deviations from a reference sequence. Part of their work was to explore hashing algorithms. We have defined a new checksum algorithm based on [previous work and analysis from VMC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12E8WbQlvfZWk5NrxwLytmympPby6vsv60RxCeD5wc1E/edit#heading=h.2nwv6g36f686), based around the SHA-512 algorithm.

The algorithm performs a SHA-512 digest of a sequence and creates a hex encoding of the first 24 bytes of the digest. An implementation may do this by sub-slicing the digest or sub-stringing 48 characters from a SHA-512 hex string. Analysis performed by VMC suggests this should be sufficient to avoid message collisions. Should a message collision occur within this scheme then the number of bytes retained from the checksum will be increased.

### Checksum Identifier Identification

When a checksum identifier is given to an implementation, it is the server's repsonsiblity to compute what kind of identifier (`MD5` or `TRUNC512`) has been given. Both can be deduced based on length; `MD5` is 32 characters long and `TRUNC512` is 48 characters long. Should we support alternative checksum based identifiers and require a more complex method to resolve their identification this will be defined in future specification versions.

## Possible Future API Enhancements

- Allow POST requests for batch downloads
- Formally define more sequence formattings (e.g. fasta, protobuf)
- Allow reference sequence checksums to be bundled together e.g. to represent a reference genome
- Support groups/collections of sequences based on checksums
- Support other methods of identifying the checksum identifier aside from length

# Appendix

## Appendix 1 - Naming Authorities

The specification makes no attempt to enforce a strict naming authority across implementations due to their potential heterogenous nature. However we do encourage implementors to reuse naming authority strings where possible. See below for more information about our recommended set of names.

| String | Authority | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `INSDC` | INSDC | Used for any identifier held in an INSDC resource (GenBank, ENA, DDBJ) |
| `UCSC` | UCSC | Used for an identifier assigned by UCSC Genome group |
| `Ensembl` | Ensembl | Used for an identifier assigned by the Ensembl project |
| `RefSeq` | RefSeq | Used for an identifier assigned by the RefSeq group |
| `vmc` | VMC | Used for when an identifier is a VMC compatible digest (as described above) |
